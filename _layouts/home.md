### Learn to speak a little Spanish

You don't need to speak Spanish fluently as long as I can know what you are saying, although the vast majority of Latin women manage to speak a little English it is important that if you do not speak e language, you learn at least the basic word and in this way, you can talk to her easily. If you try to interact correctly with the girl, she may feel some attraction to you and so she will be intrigued to meet you.
### Learn some words or phrases in Spanish

So that in this way you can approach the girl without any problem. You must be sure that you are not going to conquer a Latin girl by saying,"**Oh Dios mío, qué mami tan buena ven conmigo**" Because be sure that if you say a similar phrase, you only will do is scare her, so learn these phrases not so formal that will help you about she falls in love you.
"**Gracias, señorita**" this is an expression that is used in a way of thanks, it is a very subtle way of approaching a person and thanking for anything that person has done for you.
“**Hoy te ves preciosa, eres una chica muy bella**”, you are a very beautiful girl”, making a compliment is very important if you want to please a person, it is a way to break the ice a little and make those people grab a little affection with you.
“**Preciosa, te gustaría salir a tomar un café**”, this is a phrase that never fails and that we will use at the moment we want to ask her out. Also, it is a phrase that has a hint that any Latin woman will recognize.
### Don't try to change her personality, she won't change it – 

This is one of the conventional mistakes of men who want to make a Latin woman fall in love or seduce and this depends a lot on her personality. Simply if you don't like something about her, tell her but only when there is a lot of trust between both.
### Learn to dance, get into a course where they teach you quickly
One of the most important characteristics of any Latin woman is that they uniquely live life. Although not every Latinas like parties, when some Latin woman comes to a party, she likes to dance whatever is playing in that place.
Depending on where the Latin woman comes from and the one you are trying to conquer, she will know how to dance some musical rhythms better than others. However, in the vast majority of Latin American countries, the musical genres that are most danced are merengue, salsa, bachata, cumbia, reggaeton, electronics.
You should also take in your mind that depending on the age of the Latin woman that you are falling in love, you will have different musical genres. For example, if you want to fall in love with a girl between 20 and 35 years old, to her probably like any of the genres that we have mentioned you but if you are looking for a Latin girl with more than 40 years, to her probably not likes to listen to reggaeton or electronic music.

### Don't try to rush a relationship with a Latina woman

This is one of the fundamental keys to whether you want to have a serious relationship with a woman who is of Latin origin. Because, if you are falling in love with a Latin woman you must give her enough time for her to think about whether she wants to be with you.
Probably no Latin woman wants to have a relationship in the first moment, and if you get a woman who accepts “I congratulate you”. But for those who do not have this luck, just try to live the experiences with this girl, as you say so that "choose whether she will be with you or not", she will ask you for time and not for this means that she does not want to be with you. Latin women are complicated and a little difficult to understand, but not impossible to conquer.

### Don't debate religious issues, unless she wants it

One of the issues on which some care should be taken when speaking is the issue of religion. Every person of Latin origin from their upbringing is forced to belong to some religion, it can be catholic, Christian, evangelical, among other religions. No matter what religion this person has chosen, try not to enter into debates about their beliefs because Latin people tend to defend their religious beliefs.
Do not make the mistake of offending your religion, because this person will believe that you are not the one for her, just try to live together and when there is something more trustworthy or that person wants to talk about the subject, try to speak it subtly.

### Don't make a compliment with the name of de fruits or objects

Flattering may be a difficult task, but it is not impossible. If you want to make a compliment you don't have to use the name of any fruit for it, such as: "Pareces un tamal caliente" or "Eres tan dulce como una chupeta". Maybe, on some moments of the past these compliments will work but today other types of flattery can make a woman fall in love.
The compliments that you must make to seduce a Latin woman, must be about her personality. In this way, you can make that your girl feels unique and that she is different from the others (this is something that any Latin woman looks for in a relationship).

### Do not say that she can not be with her family

Latin women, unlike others, like to be with their family spend a full day with them and even try to get you into her family, as if you were a member of it. Do not try to avoid this, because this is a normal process for any woman, if you see it in a different way when a woman invites you to meet her family, it is because she wants a relationship with you (you should see it as one more step).
So if a Latin girl talks about her family, try to make her know that her family is wonderful and that you would love to meet her. If you have the privilege of being able to meet this girl's family, you should consider yourself a very lucky person.

“Nadie había hecho esto por mí, realmente tú eres muy especial”, if you make the latin girl, that you are trying to fall in love, feels unique and special, so that girl will be yours! because this girl every time she sees you, she will feels loved and appreciated by someone.

### Gifts make a difference

- Be gentlemanly, they love it
A gentlemanly man is one of the things that Latin women love because she likes to have a man open the door, give her a bouquet of roses, give them letters and those kinds of details that people had in past.
-Do not make the mistake of confusing chivalry with machismo, because although some women like men to do things for them, you don't have to do it all the time because they will feel that they can not do it and it is something that Latin women resent a lot.
But being gentlemanly is not only in attitude but in style, a gentlemanly man will always seek to look flawless and have a good appearance which attracts women, one of the things to which women pay close attention is personal hygiene that the person has (so take good care of her).

- Look frequently her eyes
There is an old technique that men used to seduce women and that has become one of the techniques that Latin women love and is that of eye contact.

You must find a way to vary how it surprises you since it always does the same, you can do that at any given time and she does not feel the same as she felt beginning with your details.
- cuida tu lenguaje corporal
The person's body language lets you know what that person is thinking and even what they are going to do. However, studying a person's body language can be quite complicated and although it sounds somewhat strange, most latin women can easily read men's body language just by looking at them.
-You should take care of the expressions you make with your body, such as getting tangled up when talking or making some parts of your body shake like your hands and feet. Because this will show that you are unsure of the things you are saying. Latin women love a man who is sure of the things he says as this allows them to be more confident about the person with whom they will be initiating a relationship.
- Have a sense of humor, you should look for the happy way
Finally, we find one of the qualities that most Latin women look for in men and that they have a good sense of humor. No person likes to be with someone bored and it is quite difficult to start a conversation with that person, if you like a girl, you must have different topics to be able to share with her and be able to make her express all feelings with you.
